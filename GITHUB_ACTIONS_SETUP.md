# GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide will help you set up GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Enable GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is enabled by default for all repositories. No setup needed!

### 2. Configure Secrets

Go to your GitHub repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions

Click "New repository secret" and add the following:

#### Required Secrets

| Secret Name | Description | Where to Get It |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL | Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API |

## üìã Workflow Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of 6 jobs:

### 1. Security Job
- Checks for exposed secrets
- Runs security audit
- Fails if secrets found

### 2. Lint Job
- Runs ESLint
- Checks TypeScript compilation
- Ensures code quality

### 3. Test Job
- Runs all tests
- Generates coverage report
- Uploads coverage to Codecov (optional)

### 4. Build Job
- Builds the application
- Checks bundle size
- Archives build artifacts

### 5. Dependencies Job
- Checks for unused dependencies
- Lists outdated packages
- Helps maintain clean dependencies

### 6. Deploy Job (optional)
- Deploys to Heroku on main branch
- Only runs after all other jobs pass
- Automatic deployment

---

## üîß Configuration Files

### Workflow File

**Location:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

This file defines the CI/CD pipeline. It's already created and ready to use!

### Dependabot File

**Location:** `.github/dependabot.yml`

Automates dependency updates:
- Weekly updates on Monday
- Groups updates by type
- Auto-creates PRs

---

## üéØ Triggering Workflows

### Automatic Triggers

Workflows run automatically on:
- **Push to main/develop:** Full CI/CD pipeline
- **Pull requests:** Full CI/CD pipeline (no deployment)

### Manual Triggers

You can also trigger workflows manually:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"

---

## üìä Viewing Results

### In GitHub

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click on a workflow run
3. View job details and logs

### Status Badges

Add to your README.md:

```markdown
![CI](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/workflows/CI%2FCD%20Pipeline/badge.svg)
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Secrets not found"

**Problem:** Workflow fails with missing secrets

**Solution:**
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets
- Add required secrets
- Re-run workflow

#### 2. "Tests failing"

**Problem:** Tests pass locally but fail in CI

**Solution:**
- Check environment differences
- Ensure all dependencies in package.json
- Check for hardcoded paths

#### 3. "Build fails"

**Problem:** Build succeeds locally but fails in CI

**Solution:**
- Ensure environment variables are set
- Check Node version matches
- Review build logs

#### 4. "Heroku deployment fails"

**Problem:** Deployment step fails

**Solution:**
- Verify Heroku secrets are correct
- Check Heroku app exists
- Review Heroku logs

## üîí Security Best Practices

### 1. Never Commit Secrets

- ‚ùå Don't put secrets in code
- ‚ùå Don't put secrets in workflow files
- ‚úÖ Use GitHub Secrets
- ‚úÖ Use environment variables

### 2. Limit Secret Access

- Only give secrets to jobs that need them
- Use `needs` to control job dependencies
- Review secret usage regularly

### 3. Use Dependabot

- Automatically updates dependencies
- Creates PRs for security updates
- Keeps dependencies current

---

## üìà Optimizing Workflows

### 1. Caching

The workflow uses npm caching:
```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    cache: 'npm'
```

This speeds up workflows by caching `node_modules`.

### 2. Parallel Jobs

Jobs run in parallel when possible:
- Security, Lint, Test run simultaneously
- Build waits for all to complete
- Deploy waits for Build

### 3. Conditional Jobs

Some jobs only run in certain conditions:
- Deploy only runs on main branch
- Deploy only runs on push (not PR)

---

## üé® Customizing Workflows

### Change Node Version

Edit `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'  # Change this
```

### Add More Jobs

Add a new job:

```yaml
jobs:
  my-job:
    name: My Custom Job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Do something
        run: echo "Hello"
```

### Change Triggers

Edit the `on` section:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop, feature/*]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday
```

---

## üì¶ Artifacts

### Coverage Reports

Coverage reports are uploaded as artifacts:
- Retention: 30 days
- Download from workflow run page

### Build Artifacts

Build output is uploaded:
- Retention: 7 days
- Can be downloaded for debugging

---

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

### Heroku Deployment

Automatic deployment to Heroku:
- Triggers on push to main
- Uses Heroku Deploy action
- Passes environment variables

### Other Platforms

To deploy to other platforms, modify the deploy job:

**Vercel:**
```yaml
- name: Deploy to Vercel
  uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v25
  with:
    vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
    vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.ORG_ID }}
    vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}
```

**Netlify:**
```yaml
- name: Deploy to Netlify
  uses: nwtgck/actions-netlify@v2
  with:
    publish-dir: './dist'
    production-deploy: true
  env:
    NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
    NETLIFY_SITE_ID: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_SITE_ID }}
```

---

## üìä Codecov Integration (Optional)

### Setup

1. Sign up at https://codecov.io
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Get upload token
4. Add to GitHub Secrets as `CODECOV_TOKEN`

### Benefits

- Visual coverage reports
- PR comments with coverage changes
- Coverage trends over time

---

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Keep Workflows Fast

- Use caching
- Run jobs in parallel
- Skip unnecessary steps

### 2. Fail Fast

- Run quick checks first (lint, security)
- Run slow checks last (build, deploy)
- Cancel on first failure

### 3. Clear Naming

- Use descriptive job names
- Use descriptive step names
- Add comments for complex logic

### 4. Monitor Workflow Usage

- Check Actions usage in Settings
- Optimize to stay within limits
- Use self-hosted runners for heavy workloads
